# Personal AI Ironman Coach

Sync your Garmin Connect data locally and get evidence-based Ironman coaching from any AI — Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, or anything that reads markdown.

## How It Works

```
Garmin Connect ──▶ coach sync ──▶ SQLite DB ──▶ coach context ──▶ training_context.md
                    (API)          (local)        (query+build)         │
                                                                       ▼
                                                              Cursor AI Chat
                                                          (@training_context.md
                                                            + @athlete_docs)
```

1. **`coach sync`** pulls your training activities and health metrics (HRV, sleep, stress, body battery, training readiness) from Garmin Connect into a local SQLite database.
2. **`coach context`** queries the database and generates a compact `training_context.md` — weekly volume summaries, acute/chronic training load ratio, recent activities with HR/pace/power, health trends, and auto-detected fatigue flags.
3. **In Cursor**, reference `@training_context.md` (and optionally `@athlete_docs`) in chat — the Cursor rule activates automatically and makes the AI respond as an evidence-based Ironman coach grounded in your actual data.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** — check with `python3 --version`. Install via [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or `brew install python` on macOS.
- **Garmin Connect account** — with a Garmin device syncing your training data.
- **Any AI chat** — Cursor (has auto-activating coaching rule), ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

## Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/personal-ai-coach.git
cd personal-ai-coach

# Create virtual environment and install
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Log in to Garmin Connect (credentials stored in system keychain, 2FA supported)
coach login

# Configure athlete profile (race date, goals, etc.)
coach config
```

### Athlete Context (optional but recommended)

Create an `athlete_docs/` directory with markdown files describing your profile, race targets, fueling strategy, injury history, etc. The more context you provide, the better the coaching. See `config.example.yaml` for the config format.

## Daily Workflow

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Sync latest data from Garmin (do this after each training session)
coach sync

# Generate context file for Cursor AI
coach context

# Quick status check in terminal
coach status
```

Then ask your AI for coaching:

**Cursor** (recommended) — the `.cursor/rules/ironman-coach.mdc` rule auto-activates when you reference the files:
- `@training_context.md How should I adjust this week based on my fatigue?`
- `@training_context.md @athlete_docs Review my last week — am I on track?`

**ChatGPT / Claude / any AI** — paste the contents of `training_context.md` (and optionally your `athlete_docs/`) into the chat, then ask your questions. The context file is compact (~2-5k tokens) so it's cheap to include.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `coach login` | Authenticate with Garmin Connect (saves to system keychain) |
| `coach sync` | Pull latest activities and health data from Garmin |
| `coach context` | Generate `training_context.md` for Cursor AI |
| `coach summary` | Print weekly training summary table |
| `coach status` | Show training load, health snapshot, recent activities |
| `coach config` | View/edit athlete profile (race date, goals, etc.) |
| `coach reset` | Reset local database |

### Options

```bash
coach sync --lookback 120       # Sync more history (default: 90 days)
coach sync --health-days 30     # More health data (default: 14 days)
coach summary --weeks 12        # Show more weeks
coach context --output ctx.md   # Custom output path
```

## What Data Is Synced

All data stays on your machine:

- **Activities**: sport type, duration, distance, HR zones, pace, power, TSS, training effect, elevation, cadence
- **Health metrics**: resting HR, HRV, sleep score/duration, body battery, stress, training readiness, VO2 max, weight

### Where Data Lives

| Location | What |
|----------|------|
| `~/.config/personal-ai-coach/data/coach.db` | SQLite database (activities, health metrics, sync log) |
| `~/.config/personal-ai-coach/garmin_session/` | Garmin auth tokens (avoids re-login) |
| `~/.config/personal-ai-coach/config.yaml` | Athlete profile (race date, goals — no secrets) |
| macOS Keychain | Garmin email + password (service: `personal-ai-coach`) |
| `training_context.md` (project root) | Generated context for Cursor AI (gitignored) |
| `athlete_docs/` (project root) | Your personal coaching docs (gitignored) |

You can query the database directly:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.config/personal-ai-coach/data/coach.db \
  "SELECT start_time, sport_type, duration_seconds/60 as mins, distance_meters/1000 as km, avg_hr FROM activities ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

## Security

- Garmin credentials are stored in your OS credential store (macOS Keychain / Linux SecretService / Windows Credential Locker), not in any file
- 2FA/MFA is supported — you'll be prompted in the terminal when needed
- No data is sent anywhere except to Garmin Connect (for sync) and your AI tool (when you chat)
- `athlete_docs/`, `training_context.md`, and `config.yaml` are gitignored — your personal health data never hits the repo

## Platform Support

Tested on macOS. Should work on Linux and Windows since all dependencies are cross-platform:
- `keyring` uses the native OS credential store on each platform
- `sqlite3` is built into Python
- `garminconnect` is pure Python
